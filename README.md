<h1>Building A Web App and Adding an SSL Certificate</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consisted of setting up a domain through GoDaddy and then creating a web application using Azure Labs. Using the tools available within Azure, a resource group, virtual network, and network security group were set up, complete with accessibility rules. Additionally, three virtual machines were established, one being a jump box while the other two were used for web access. The jump box virtual machine was used to set up a docker container, provisioner, and Ansible playbook. A load balancer was also set up, configuring a static IP address and a backend pool connecting both web virtual machines to it. Using OpenSSL, self-signed certificates were created and then added to a Key Vault so that they could be bound to the web application.
